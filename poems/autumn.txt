In autumn's grasp, the leaves let go,
A symphony of colors in a tranquil flow.
The trees ablaze with fiery shades,
As nature's artistry in the forest parades.

The harvest moon rises, bold and bright,
Casting a serene and silvery light.
A crispness lingers in the air,
As autumn's magic is everywhere.

The geese in formation start their flight,
Heading southward through the night.
Leaves carpet the ground with hues of gold,
As the world prepares for winter's cold.

Pumpkins on porches, a harvest feast,
Autumn's blessings are not the least.
A time of reflection, a season of change,
In nature's cycle, nothing stays the same.
