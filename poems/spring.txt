In springtime's gentle, warming grace,
The earth awakes from winter's embrace.
With petals soft and colors flashy,
New life emerges, stories untold.

The cherry blossoms bloom with pride,
Their pink and white in shades collide.
As daffodils dance in golden glee,
Beneath the budding cherry tree.

The robin's song in the morning light,
Echoes hope, a melody so bright.
And streams rush forth with newfound flow,
From melting snows, their source below.

The world is bathed in hues so fair,
As spring paints life upon the air.
A time of renewal, a vibrant birth,
For all that lives upon this earth.

With every bloom, with every breeze,
Spring whispers secrets in the trees.
A season of promise, where dreams take flight,
In spring's embrace, all feels so right.
