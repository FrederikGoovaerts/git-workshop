In summer's embrace, the sun ascends,
Its golden rays, a warmth that transcends.
The days stretch long, the nights so clear,
In this radiant season, we gather near.

The medows sway in a sea of green,
A lush expanse, a tranquil scene.
With butterflies dancing, and bees that hum,
In the symphony of summer, where all is calm.

The river's current, a gentle flow,
Reflects the azure sky's vibrant glow.
As children laugh and splash with glee,
In nature's playground, wild and free.

Fields of wildflowers in colors arrayed,
In the summer breeze, they softly sway.
Their fragrant petals perfume the air,
A sensory delight beyond compare.


The farmer's market bustles with life,
Abundant produce, free from strife.
Tomatoes ripe, and corn so sweet,
Summer's bounty, a seasonal treat.
