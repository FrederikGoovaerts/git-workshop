In winter's grasp, the world stands still,
As snowflakes fall, a silent thrill.
A frosty kiss on the landscape's face,
In the hush of winter, there's a special grace.

The trees are dressed in icicles and frost,
A wintry wonderland, not to be lost.
Footprints in the snow, a solitary trace,
As winter blankets the earth in its embrace.

The hearth's warm glow, a cozy retreat,
As the cold outside becomes obsolete.
With mittens and scarves, we bundle tight,
In the quiet of winter's long, dark night.

A season of stillness, of solitude and cold,
But within, there's a warmth that never grows old.
For in winter's embrace, we find our way,
To appreciate the beauty of each passing day.
